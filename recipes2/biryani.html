    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>Chicken biryani is one of the most popular Indian chicken dishes. In the recipe below, I present one of the best & simple chicken biryani recipes that we frequently prepare at home. When the biryani is cooked as per instructions given in the recipe, the chicken remains juicy, tender, flavor-packed, masaledar, and finger-licking good.<br> The recipe is so easy that even first-time cooks and bachelors can try it in their kitchen!</p>
